# wundertemp
This is a command-line scraper of current temperature and weather conditions from Weather Underground (http://wunderground.com).

Run it with `python3 wundertemp.py` on the command line to find out how to use it.

This was the first Python project I worked on while on a programming retreat at Recurse Center.
